# Synvera

**Synvera** is a high-performance medical billing calculator built exclusively for neurosurgeons. It solves the operational friction of reconciling the SBN (*Sociedade Brasileira de Neurocirurgia*) specialty catalog with the CBHPM (*Classificação Brasileira Hierarquizada de Procedimentos Médicos*) valuation table — producing a precise, real-time fee breakdown for the entire surgical team in seconds.

The entire system is built under **Spec-Driven Design (SDD)**: the OpenAPI contract (`openapi.yaml`) is the single source of truth and precedes every implementation decision.

## Features

- **Physician workspace** — authenticated home at `/` showing recent compositions, quick-access tools, and release notes; unauthenticated visitors see a minimal branded entry screen
- **Novo cálculo** — search-first calculation entry at `/novo-calculo`; privacy-first minimalist UI with no financial data visible before a procedure is selected
- **Real-time composition** — select an SBN procedure, pick which CBHPM codes were performed, toggle the access route and anesthesia; fees recalculate in under 150 ms
- **Multi-procedure support** — compose multiple SBN procedures in one bill; CBHPM 4.1/4.2 discount rules applied automatically
- **CBHPM-mandated auxiliaries** — auxiliary count is locked to the value specified in the CBHPM 2022 manual when the selected codes define it; free selection otherwise
- **Save compositions** — name and persist a procedural template (SBN procedure + codes + access route + aux + anesthesia) with no financial data; fees always recalculate from the current CBHPM table on load
- **Manage compositions** — list, reload, edit, and delete saved compositions; accessible from the workspace home and the "Minhas composições" tab on `/novo-calculo`
- **Shareable report** — copy a pre-filled URL that reconstructs the exact calculation state for any recipient

## Business Rules

### CBHPM 4.1 / 4.2 — Multi-procedure discount

When multiple codes are billed in the same surgical act:

| Scenario | Rate applied to additional procedures |
|---|---|
| Same access route (CBHPM 4.1) | 50% |
| Different access routes (CBHPM 4.2) | 70% |

The principal procedure (highest porte value) is always billed at 100%.

### CBHPM 5.1 / 5.2 — Auxiliary surgeon fees

Auxiliary fees are computed on the lead surgeon's total fee, not on `total_base`:

| Position | Percentage |
|---|---|
| 1st auxiliary | 60% |
| 2nd auxiliary | 40% |
| 3rd auxiliary | 30% |
| 4th auxiliary | 30% |

The number of auxiliaries is determined by the highest `num_auxiliaries` value among the selected codes (CBHPM 5.2). When the manual mandates a value, the UI locks the selector automatically.

### Anesthesiologist

Optional fixed fee of **R$ 1,200.00** when the anesthesia toggle is enabled.

See [Domain Model](docs/domain-model.md) for the complete valuation specification.

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

Open the repo root in VS Code and accept **"Reopen in Container"** to load the pre-configured Dev Container (Go, Node.js, psql, pdfplumber included).

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` to connect to Neon. Without it the server falls back to the embedded `procedures.json` catalog (suitable for development).

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Next.js dev server runs on `http://localhost:3000` with Turbopack.

### Database

Apply migrations in order against your Neon database:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f backend/db/migrations/001_schema.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f backend/db/migrations/002_seed_portes.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f backend/db/migrations/003_seed_procedures.sql
# ... through 008
```

Migration 003 is generated from `procedures.json` via `data/generate_seed.py`. Re-run the script after updating the procedure catalog.

### ETL (procedure catalog)

```bash
# Requires: pdfplumber (pip install pdfplumber)
# Optional: poppler-utils (pdftotext) for full SBN PDF re-parse
python3 data/generate_catalog.py   # → backend/internal/repository/procedures.json
python3 data/generate_seed.py      # → backend/db/migrations/003_seed_procedures.sql
```
