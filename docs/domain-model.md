# Domain Model — Synvera

## Business Context

Synvera is a medical billing calculator for neurosurgeons in Brazil. Physicians bill insurance companies using the **CBHPM** table (Classificação Brasileira Hierarquizada de Procedimentos Médicos). The **SBN** (Sociedade Brasileira de Neurocirurgia) groups related CBHPM codes into named surgical packages for practical use.

One SBN surgical package maps to **one or more** CBHPM billable codes. Each code carries an intrinsic **porte** (complexity class) that determines its monetary value. The physician selects which codes were actually performed and declares whether the procedures shared the same access route — this drives the multi-procedure discount rule.

---

## Domain Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Physician Account** | An authenticated Synvera user. Maps a Clerk identity (JWT `sub`) to an internal UUID. Created automatically on first sign-in. |
| **SBN Procedure** | A named surgical package published by the SBN. Has a code and a human-readable name. |
| **CBHPM Code** | A billable line item from the national procedure table. Has a code, description, and an intrinsic porte. |
| **Porte** | A complexity class (e.g. `7A`, `8B`) with a fixed BRL value defined by CBHPM 2025/2026 (Faixa Original). Read-only — the physician cannot change a code's porte. |
| **AccessRouteType** | `same` (CBHPM 4.1) or `different` (CBHPM 4.2). Drives the multi-procedure discount rate. |
| **Composition** | A reusable surgical template owned by a physician: SBN procedure + selected CBHPM codes + access route + anesthesia + aux count + user-defined name. **Contains no financial values.** Values are always recalculated fresh. |
| **Calculation** | The computed monetary breakdown of a composition or manual selection. Always derived on the fly from current CBHPM porte values — never stored as the primary artifact. |
| **Shared Calculation** | A snapshot of a completed calculation stored in the `calculations` table for external review via a shareable URL. Legacy persistence model; used only for the share-report flow. Public — no authentication required. |
| **Valuation** | Synonym for Calculation in the UI context. |

## CBHPM Code Selectability

Per the SBN Manual de Codificação (MCPN), item 6:

> "A recomendação é que não haja desmembramento na relação de códigos cirúrgicos, salvo naquelas situações em que há um (*) enfatizando a ressalva no próprio rodapé da cirurgia."

All codes in an SBN procedure list are included by default. Only codes marked with `(*)` in the SBN manual are conditionally applicable. The UI currently allows free deselection; this should be improved in a future release to distinguish mandatory from optional codes.

---

## Valuation Engine

### Step 1 — Resolve porte values

For each selected CBHPM code, look up `PorteValues[code.porte]` (CBHPM 2025/2026, Faixa Original).

### Step 2 — Identify the principal procedure

The principal procedure is the code with the highest monetary porte value.

### Step 3 — Apply multi-procedure discount (CBHPM 4.1 / 4.2)

**Single procedure**: surgeon fee = 100% of its porte value (no discount).

**Same access route (CBHPM item 4.1)**:
```
surgeon_fee = principal_value + 0.50 × Σ(all other selected porte values)
```

**Different access routes (CBHPM item 4.2)**:
```
surgeon_fee = principal_value + 0.70 × Σ(all other selected porte values)
```

`total_base` (sum of all values before discounting) is preserved in the response for reference.

### Step 4 — Auxiliary surgeon fees (CBHPM 5.1 applied to surgeon total per 5.2)

Auxiliary fees are computed on the **surgeon_fee** (not on total_base), per CBHPM item 5.2.

| Position | Percentage |
|----------|-----------|
| 1st auxiliary | **60%** |
| 2nd auxiliary | **40%** |
| 3rd auxiliary | **30%** |
| 4th auxiliary | **30%** |

### Step 5 — Anesthesiologist

Optional fixed fee of R$ 1,200.00 when `requires_anesthesia = true`.

### Step 6 — Final total

```
final_total = surgeon_fee + Σ(auxiliary_fees) + anesthesiologist_fee
```

## CBHPM Auxiliary Counts (`num_auxiliaries`)

### Source

The CBHPM 2022 document (`CBHPM-2022_versao-agosto-2023.pdf`) Chapter 3 contains a six-column surgical procedure table:

```
Código | Procedimento | Porte | Custo Oper. | N° de Aux. | Anest.
```

The **N° de Aux.** column specifies the maximum number of auxiliary surgeons for each surgical code. A dash (`–`) means zero auxiliaries.

Chapters 1 (Consultas), 2 (Clínica), and 4 (Diagnóstico) have **no auxiliary column** — those codes always default to `num_auxiliaries = 0`.

### Distribution (184 catalog codes)

| num_auxiliaries | count |
|---|---|
| 0 | 48 |
| 1 | 68 |
| 2 | 60 |
| 3 | 8 |

### Data Flow

```
CBHPM-2022_versao-agosto-2023.pdf  ← official source
  │ (data/generate_catalog.py → parse_cbhpm_aux())
  ▼
procedures.json[].num_auxiliaries      ← enriched per-code field
  │ (data/generate_seed.py)
  ▼
003_seed_procedures.sql                ← INSERT … num_auxiliaries = N
  │ (applied on fresh database)
  ▼
cbhpm_codes.num_auxiliaries            ← live DB column
```

Migration `007_populate_num_auxiliaries.sql` contains 184 idempotent `UPDATE`
statements to backfill existing production databases that ran migration 003
before the aux-count enrichment was implemented.

### What Was Missing / Root Cause

Migration 005 (`add num_auxiliaries`) added the column with `DEFAULT 0` but never populated it because:

1. `data/generate_catalog.py` only parsed the **SBN MCPN PDF** — which has no N° Aux. column.
2. The CBHPM 2022 PDF (which does have N° Aux.) was used only for porte values, never for auxiliary counts.
3. `data/generate_seed.py` never emitted `num_auxiliaries` in its INSERT.

Result: all 184 codes retained the schema default of `0`.

### Automatic Suggestion Status

`cbhpm_codes.num_auxiliaries` is now populated from the official source. The
backend already returns it via `GET /api/procedures/{id}`. The frontend type
`CBHPMCode` already declares `num_auxiliaries: number`.

**Automatic suggestion** ("set auxiliariesCount to the max num_auxiliaries
among selected codes") can now be implemented safely — the data is correct
and end-to-end. No additional domain validation is required before shipping
that feature.

## Composition Persistence (Primary Model)

### Overview

A **Composition** is the physician's reusable surgical template. It captures the procedural intent (which codes, which access route, how many auxiliaries) without embedding any monetary values. Storing compositions instead of calculations ensures that fees always reflect the current CBHPM table when the physician re-opens them.

### Entity: `Composition`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `UUID` (PK) | Internal primary key. Never exposed externally. |
| `public_id` | `UUID v4` | External identifier used in all API responses and URLs. Immutable after creation. |
| `name` | `TEXT` | Physician-assigned label (e.g. "Craniotomia + DVP"). |
| `sbn_procedure_id` | `TEXT` (nullable) | SBN catalog ID of the primary procedure. |
| `sbn_procedure_name` | `TEXT` | Human-readable name of the primary procedure. |
| `selected_codes` | `JSONB` | Array of `{cbhpm_code, description, porte}` objects selected by the physician. |
| `access_route_type` | `TEXT` | `"same"` or `"different"` (CBHPM 4.1/4.2). |
| `auxiliaries_count` | `INT` | 0–4. |
| `requires_anesthesia` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to include anesthesiologist fee. |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Record timestamps. |

### Composition API Flows

```
POST /api/compositions
  body: { name, sbn_procedure_id?, sbn_procedure_name,
          selected_codes, access_route_type, auxiliaries_count, requires_anesthesia }
  → 201 { public_id, created_at }

GET /api/compositions
  → 200 [CompositionItem]   (ordered by created_at DESC)

GET /api/compositions/{public_id}
  → 200 CompositionDetail   (includes selected_codes, updated_at)
  → 404 if not found

PUT /api/compositions/{public_id}
  body: same shape as POST
  → 200 CompositionDetail   (with updated_at refreshed)
  → 404 if not found

DELETE /api/compositions/{public_id}
  → 204 No Content
  → 404 if not found
```

### Frontend UX — Save as Composition

On the procedure page, after a valuation appears, a "Salvar composição" button is shown. On click:

1. An inline name-input form appears (pre-focused).
2. The physician types a label and presses Enter or clicks "Salvar".
3. A `POST /api/compositions` request is made with the current state — **no financial fields included**.
4. On success, a confirmation chip appears: **"Composição salva! Ver minhas composições"**.
5. Any subsequent change to the composition resets the saved indicator.

When a composition is loaded from URL (`/procedure?composition={public_id}`):

1. `GET /api/compositions/{id}` restores all procedural state.
2. `GET /api/procedures/{sbn_procedure_id}` reloads the full CBHPM code list.
3. The procedure page shows "Editando composição: {name}" in the subtitle.
4. The save button becomes "Atualizar composição" → `PUT /api/compositions/{id}`.

### Home Page — Minhas Composições

The home page "Minhas composições" tab lists saved compositions (no financial data displayed). Each card shows: name, SBN procedure, date, aux count, anesthesia, access route. Cards link to `/procedure?composition={public_id}`. A trash button calls `DELETE /api/compositions/{public_id}`.

## Premium Sharing (v2.3.0)

### Purpose

Premium Sharing transforms the shared calculation page into a professional medical report suitable for distribution to surgeons, hospitals, auditors, and administrative staff.

### Characteristics

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Route | `/share?sbn=…&codes=…&a=…&an=…&route=…` |
| State | Read-only snapshot; values recalculated live from current CBHPM table |
| Actions | Copiar link · Imprimir relatório |
| Excluded | Dark mode · Edit controls · Composition save · PDF generation |
| Metadata | Open Graph title/description via `app/share/layout.tsx` |
| Print | `@media print` CSS: hides actions, swaps dark total section, avoids breaks |

### Relationship to other concepts

- A **Composition** is the reusable template owned by the physician.
- A **Shared Calculation** (Premium Sharing) is the public-facing report — a live recalculation of parameters encoded in a URL, not a stored entity.
- A **Shared Calculation snapshot** (legacy `calculations` table) is an optional stored record used only if/when the clean-URL feature is implemented.

PDF generation is intentionally out of scope for v2.3.0. The browser's print-to-PDF produces an equivalent result.

---

## Calculation Persistence (Legacy — Share Flow Only)

### Overview

The `calculations` table (migration 006) is retained **solely** to support the share-report feature, where a completed valuation snapshot is persisted so an external reviewer can open a stable URL and see the same breakdown the physician saw. No new features are being built on top of this model.

### Entity: `Calculation`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `UUID` (PK) | Internal primary key. **Never exposed externally.** |
| `public_id` | `UUID v4` | External identifier used in all API responses and future shareable URLs (e.g. `/calc/{public_id}`). Immutable after creation. |
| `procedure_name` | `TEXT` | SBN procedure name(s) as displayed at save time. |
| `procedure_sbn_code` | `TEXT` (nullable) | SBN catalog ID of the primary procedure. |
| `selected_cbhpm_codes` | `JSONB` | Array of `{cbhpm_code, description, porte}` objects selected at save time. |
| `access_route` | `TEXT` | `"same"` or `"different"` (CBHPM 4.1/4.2). |
| `auxiliaries_count` | `INT` | 0–4. |
| `requires_anesthesia` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether anesthesia was included. |
| `surgeon_value` | `NUMERIC(12,2)` | Lead surgeon fee (= `lead_surgeon_fee` from `CalculateResponse`). |
| `auxiliaries_total_value` | `NUMERIC(12,2)` | Sum of all auxiliary fees. |
| `anesthesiologist_value` | `NUMERIC(12,2)` | Anesthesiologist fee (0 if not applicable). |
| `team_total_value` | `NUMERIC(12,2)` | Grand total of the entire team. |
| `calculation_breakdown` | `JSONB` | Full `CalculateResponse` JSON preserved verbatim for auditing. |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Record timestamps. |

### Identifier Design

Two separate UUIDs serve distinct roles:

- **`id`** — internal DB primary key generated by `gen_random_uuid()`. Used only for internal joins. Never sent in API responses.
- **`public_id`** — UUID v4 generated in application code via `crypto/rand`. Used in all API responses and future shareable URLs (`/calc/{public_id}`). Immutable after creation. This decouples the external identifier from the internal storage layout, enabling future table restructuring without breaking URLs.

### Canonical Table

The active table for saved calculations is **`calculations`** (migration 006).

The name `saved_calculations` is a legacy alias that **must not be referenced** by any current runtime code (handlers, repository implementations, SQL queries, or tests). Any reference to `saved_calculations` in new code is a bug.

### Save Flow

```
POST /api/calculations
  body: SaveCalculationRequest {
    procedure_name, procedure_sbn_code?,
    selected_codes, auxiliaries_count, requires_anesthesia, access_route_type,
    calculation_result: CalculateResponse  ← must have lead_surgeon_fee > 0
  }
  → 201 SaveCalculationResponse { public_id, created_at }
```

**Validation gate**: `calculation_result.lead_surgeon_fee > 0` ensures only completed valuations (not empty or partial inputs) are persisted.

### Retrieval Flow

```
GET /api/calculations/{public_id}
  → 200 SavedCalculation { public_id, procedure_name, selected_cbhpm_codes,
                            access_route_type, surgeon_value, team_total_value,
                            calculation_breakdown, created_at, … }
  → 404  if public_id not found
```

### Delete Flow

```
DELETE /api/calculations/{public_id}
  → 204 No Content  on success
  → 404             if public_id not found
  → 405             for any other method on /api/calculations/{id}
```

Deletion is permanent. The physician is shown a confirmation dialog before the request is sent.

### Frontend UX (Share Flow Only)

The "Compartilhar cálculo" button on the procedure page encodes the current selection as URL query params (`/share?sbn=…&codes=…`). The share page calls `POST /api/calculations` internally to produce a stable snapshot for the external reviewer. The physician does not interact with this flow directly as a "save" action.

### Future Evolution

The schema is intentionally designed for a future `Calculation → User` foreign key:

```sql
-- Migration 007 (future):
ALTER TABLE calculations ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_calculations_user_id ON calculations (user_id);
```

No existing data is broken by this additive migration. The `public_id` UUID survives as the stable URL key regardless of account linkage.

## Future Expansion

- **Payer-specific faixa**: CBHPM 2025/2026 defines Faixas I, II, III with different monetary multipliers. Add a `faixa` selector per payer.
- **(*)-optional codes**: Mark SBN catalog codes as optional vs mandatory and enforce this in the UI.
- **Emergency surcharge**: CBHPM item 2.1 adds 30% for procedures performed at night / weekends / holidays.
- **Pediatric surcharges**: CBHPM items 4.6–4.8 add 30–100% for young patients.
- **Multi-session bills**: Allow composing multiple SBN procedures in one calculation (each with its own access route).
- **Payer-specific porte overrides**: Add `payer_porte_overrides` table for negotiated portes.
